          Nestled in the heart of Hawaii, the Anahulu Valley Preservation Fund is dedicated to protecting the sacred lands, cultural treasures, and natural beauty of our cherished valley. Mana’o Pili partners with the Anahulu Valley Preservation fund.  Each month, a portion of our proceeds is directed toward restoring, safeguarding, and preserving the valley’s rich history, from ancient fish ponds to historic burial grounds that tell the stories of our ancestors.
